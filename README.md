# 📊 Credit Score Model

# 🌟 Overview
This project involves developing a Credit Score Prediction Model to determine the creditworthiness of individuals. Using a machine learning pipeline, the project cleans, processes, and analyzes financial data to create a reliable model for predicting credit scores.

The notebook is designed to be modular, allowing for easy adjustments based on the dataset or specific requirements.

# 🚀 Features
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, fills inconsistencies, and removes irrelevant data points.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates visualizations to uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers in the dataset.

Feature Engineering:
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., using Label Encoding).

Scaling numerical variables (e.g., using Standard Scaler).
Machine Learning Models:
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting

Additional algorithms based on user needs.


# 🛠️ Requirements
Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the notebook:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)


Dataset in CSV format
# 📂 Dataset
The project expects a dataset in the form of a .csv file. Replace credit_record.csv with the path to your dataset. The dataset should ideally include:

Categorical Variables (e.g., marital status, occupation type).
Numerical Variables (e.g., income, loan amount).
Target Variable: A label that indicates credit risk or score.
Example Columns:
Customer_ID
Age
Monthly_Income
Loan_Amount
Default_Risk (Target variable)


# 📋 Steps to Run
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/neer0801/Credit-Score-Model
cd credit-score-model
Prepare the Dataset:
Ensure your dataset (credit_record.csv) is placed in the same directory as the notebook.
Modify the dataset loading path in the notebook if necessary.
Run the Notebook:
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open and execute the cells in Credit_Score_Model.ipynb.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
EDA:

Visualize data trends using box plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
Train Models:

Fit machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Predict:

Use the trained model to predict credit scores for new data.
# 📈 Visualization Highlights
Box Plots:

Identify outliers in numerical variables.
Example:
python
Copy code
sns.boxplot(data=df['Loan_Amount'])
plt.show()
Heatmap:

Correlation matrix for numerical variables.
python
Copy code
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
Histograms:

Distribution of income, loan amounts, etc.


# 🤖 Machine Learning Models
The notebook supports various machine learning models. Here’s a brief explanation of their purpose:

Decision Trees:

Simple interpretable models for classification tasks.
Random Forest:

Ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy and generalization.
Gradient Boosting:

Powerful ensemble technique suitable for handling complex datasets.
Model Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score


# 📝 Results
The performance of each model is summarized and compared using evaluation metrics. Select the best-performing model based on your dataset and business needs.

# 💡 Conclusion
The Credit Score Model is a robust starting point for predicting credit risk. Its modular design makes it adaptable for various industries, including banking and finance.

# Next Steps:
Implement more advanced feature engineering techniques (e.g., PCA).
Test on larger datasets for scalability.
Deploy the model as a web application or API.
